## What was implemented

- A map showing all launches.
- Ability to filter only successful launches and back to all.
- Basic console log of errors.
- Spinner for fetching.
- List of agencies

## Not implemented

- Possibility to filter by agency
- Possibility to filter by launch pad

 These two features require deeper understanding of API, it got bad docs

- Tests

## Room for improvements

- I've had no time for proper styling, i'd love to make it fancier.
- Test coverage.
